# Alx-Project-Familyz

## Introduction
As the world evolves and people doesn’t necessarily form a family with a mate from the same tribe or country, or are simply too far from their home country to reconnect with their relatives, it’s no longer easy for the new born childs to know about those that came before them especially when the parent did not teach enough about that. Who is related to their father or mother ? Do they have a relative (uncle, aunt, cousin, …) in another country ?
Those are the questions we’re trying to solve with Familyz.
